# Android - User Activity Prediction using SVM 

The objective of this project is to build an application which recognizes human activities using supervised machine learning algorithms. To recognize the activities, gathering actual human actions during daily life is the first step. We will solve this gathering issue using the smartphone. Nowadays, most people have their smartphone and the smartphones have many sensors such as accelerometer, gyroscope, orientation, GPS, proximity, etc. By using these sensors, we can obtain the datasets and classify the dataset using support vector machine (SVM). Once after this training, we classify the realtime user ativity based on the SVM model we generated during the training phase. Also, we measure the accuracy and crossvalidation of the model during the training phase.
